# Retinal Disease Diagnosis using Deep Learning

A deep learning–based retinal disease classification system built using CNN-based transfer learning models.  
This project demonstrates applied AI in healthcare with a strong focus on accuracy, interpretability, and real-world readiness.

---

## Model Architecture
- Custom CNN (baseline)
- ResNet50
- DenseNet121
- **EfficientNetB3 (Best Performing Model)**

EfficientNetB3 achieved the highest accuracy due to efficient feature extraction and superior generalization on retinal fundus images.

---

## Dataset
- **Source:** Eye Diseases Classification Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Image Type:** Retinal Fundus Images
- **Classes:** Cataract, Diabetic Retinopathy, Glaucoma, Normal

---

## Performance
- **Best Accuracy:** ~89%
- **Task:** Multi-class image classification  
- Robust performance across all disease classes using transfer learning techniques.

---

## Explainable AI (XAI)
- **Grad-CAM:** Highlights important retinal regions influencing model predictions  
- **LIME:** Provides local explanations for individual predictions  

These techniques improve transparency and trust, which is critical for healthcare-oriented AI systems.
