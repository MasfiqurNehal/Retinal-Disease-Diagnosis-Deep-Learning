# Retinal Disease Diagnosis using Deep Learning

A deep learning–based retinal disease classification system built using CNN-based transfer learning models.  
This project demonstrates applied AI in healthcare with a strong focus on accuracy, interpretability, and real-world readiness.

---

## Model Architecture
- Custom CNN (baseline)
- ResNet50
- DenseNet121
- **EfficientNetB3 (Best Performing Model)**

EfficientNetB3 achieved the highest accuracy due to efficient feature extraction and superior generalization on retinal fundus images.
